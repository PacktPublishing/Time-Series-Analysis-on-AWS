This is the code repository for [Time Series Analysis on AWS](https://www.packtpub.com/product/time-series-analysis-on-aws/9781801816847), published by Packt.

**Learn how to build forecasting models and detect anomalies in your time series data**

## What is this book about?
Being a business analyst and data scientist, you have to use many algorithms and approaches to prepare, process, and build ML-based applications by leveraging time series data, but you face common problems, such as not knowing which algorithm to choose or how to combine and interpret them. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides numerous services to help you build applications fueled by artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. This book helps you get to grips with three AWS AI/ML-managed services to enable you to deliver your desired business outcomes.

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* Understand how time series data differs from other types of data
* Explore the key challenges that can be solved using time series data
* Forecast future values of business metrics using Amazon Forecast
* Detect anomalies and deliver forewarnings using Lookout for Equipment
* Detect anomalies in business metrics using Amazon Lookout for Metrics
* Visualize your predictions to reduce the time to extract insights

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
START = '2013-06-01'
END = '2013-07-31'
DATASET = 'household_energy_consumption'
FORECAST_PREFIX = 'export_energy_consumption_XXXX'
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you're a data analyst, business analyst, or data scientist looking to analyze time series data effectively for solving business problems, this is the book for you. Basic statistics knowledge is assumed, but no machine learning knowledge is necessary. Prior experience with time series data and how it relates to various business problems will help you get the most out of this book. This guide will also help machine learning practitioners find new ways to leverage their skills to build effective time series-based applications.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
